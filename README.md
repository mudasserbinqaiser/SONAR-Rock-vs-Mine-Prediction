# SONAR-Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction
This is a Machine Learning project for supervised learning.  In this project, I am building a system in Python that can predict whether an object under the sea is either Rock or Mine with SONAR Data. For this use case, I am using Logistic Regression Model for the prediction.
